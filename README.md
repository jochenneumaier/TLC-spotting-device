Column chromatography and the subsequent analysis of the collected fractions using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) are immensely popular and frequently used methods in organic chemistry. To analyze the fractions, they have to be spotted onto the TLC plates, which can be a time-consuming task. Therefore, we have developed an automatic spotting device based on a conversion of a 3D printer kit, which could be easily built for around 500 â‚¬. All parts come directly from the 3D printer kit, are 3D printed, or are commercially available, such as syringes and tubing. In this manuscript, we describe the design and use of the spotting device. In addition, we provide a detailed step-by-step assembly instruction and all CAD files for easy replication
